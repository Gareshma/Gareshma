## Hey there, I'm Gareshma! 👋  
Once upon a time, I wrote my first `Hello World`. Now, nearly **4 years** later, I’m building scalable backends, clean APIs, and integrations that make enterprise applications work reliably and efficiently.

Currently, I’m pursuing my **Master’s in Computer Science** at **Santa Clara University**, where I’m perfecting the art of making code elegant, efficient, and slightly magical.

Currently exploring **Python** & **Swift**, chasing the dream of becoming a true **Full Stack Developer**.
